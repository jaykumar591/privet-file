    <h1 class="heading"><a href="c.programing.html">C PROGRAMING</a></h1>
    <p class="paragraph">C programming is a widely used and influential programming language that was developed in the early <em class="importent"> 1972s</em> at Bell Labs by <em class="importent"> Dennis Ritchie.</em> It is a general-purpose programming language known for its simplicity and efficiency, and it has had a significant impact on the development of many other programming languages. </p>
    <ol>
        <li class="numberheading">Procedural Language</li>
        <a class="para">C is primarily a procedural programming language, which means it follows a top-down approach where the program is divided into functions or procedures. It excels in tasks where a sequence of steps needs to be performed.</a>
        <li class="numberheading">Low-Level Features</li>
        <a class="para">C provides low-level access to memory and hardware, making it suitable for system-level programming and embedded systems. This feature allows programmers to write efficient code and manipulate hardware directly.</a>
        <li class="numberheading">Portability</li>
        <a class="para">C is designed to be highly portable, which means that programs written in C can be compiled and run on different hardware platforms with minimal modifications. This portability is facilitated by the use of compilers specific to each platform.</a>
        <li class="numberheading">Standard Library</li>
        <a class="para">C comes with a standard library that provides a set of functions and macros for common tasks like input/output operations, string manipulation, memory management, and more. This library simplifies many programming tasks.</a>
        <li class="numberheading">Efficiency:</li>
        <a class="para">C programs are known for their efficiency and performance. The language allows fine-grained control over memory management and system resources, making it suitable for applications where speed and resource utilization are critical.</a>
        <li class="numberheading">Static Typing</li>
        <a class="para">C is statically typed, which means that variable types must be declared before they are used. This helps catch type-related errors at compile-time, reducing runtime errors.</a>
        <li class="numberheading">Community and Ecosystem</li>
        <a class="para">C has a large and active community of developers and a wealth of resources, including books, online tutorials, and forums. This makes it easier for newcomers to learn and seek help when needed.</a>
        <li class="numberheading">Influence on Other Languages</li>
        <a class="para">C has had a significant influence on the development of many other programming languages, including C++, C#, Objective-C, and more. Understanding C can be beneficial when learning these related languages.</a>
